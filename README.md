Tetris is a puzzle video game created by Soviet software engineer Alexey Pajitnov in 1984. It has been published by several companies for multiple platforms, most prominently during a dispute over the appropriation of the rights in the late 1980s.

This project was only made to have fun and help learning (and learn). As you may suppose, I'm not a professional game-developer, but I hope it's useful to somebody.

## Installation

The only package you will need to run the game is [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news). If you haven't installed it yet, you can download it with the following command:

```sh
pip3 install pygame
```

This project was developed with pygame 2.1.2.
